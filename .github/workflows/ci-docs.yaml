# As a result, the set of jobs in this file should be equal to that in ci.yaml.
#
# Note that if a PR contains changes of both markdown files and non-markdown files,
# there'll be twins for each check (e.g., https://github.com/runfinch/finch/pull/88).
# However, due to GitHub's logic, even though the one from ci-docs.yaml passes,
# the one from ci.yaml still has to pass for the PR to be merged,
# so it functionally works, while it's visually confusing.
