# This file is created according to
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks
# As a result, the set of jobs in this file should be equal to that in ci.yaml.
#
# Note that if a PR contains changes of both markdown files and non-markdown files,
# there'll be twins for each check (e.g., https://github.com/runfinch/finch/pull/88).
# However, due to GitHub's logic, even though the one from ci-docs.yaml passes,
# the one from ci.yaml still has to pass for the PR to be merged,
# so it functionally works, while it's visually confusing.
