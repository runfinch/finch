// Package e2e is created because:
//
// During test setup, SetupLocalRegistry is called,
// and container tests need to be run before VM tests
// so that the local registry won't be removed by VM tests,
// and container tests can use the images stored in it.
//
// However, by default Ginkgo does not guarantee the order in which specs run [1],
// and Ginkgo doc says that "You should only ever call RunSpecs once" [2],
// which means that we need two binaries that run VM tests and container tests respectively.
//
// We could add ginkgo.Ordered to the top level Ginkgo container,
// but that will make every single spec to run in the order they are defined:
// "Any container nodes nested within a container node will automatically be considered Ordered
// and there is no way to mark a node within an Ordered container as "not Ordered"" [1],
// and we don't want that because it can hide implicit dependencies among tests,
// while each test should be independent unless specially designed.
//
// As a result, we split the tests into `e2e/vm` and `e2e/container` packages
// and extract the common logic into this package.
